To use this script:  1.  **Create a new text file.** You can use any text editor, such as Notepad, TextEdit, or a code editor like Visual Studio Code. 2.  **Paste the code into the file.** 3.  **Save the file with a `.html` extension.** For example, `index.html`. 4.  **Open the file in a web browser.** You can double-click the file or open it from your browser's File menu.  You should see a webpage with the text "Hello, World\!" and "This is my first website."  Here's a breakdown of the code:    * **<!DOCTYPE html>:** This declaration tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.   * **<html></html>:** This is the root element of an HTML page.   * **<head></head>:** This contains meta-information about the page, such as the title.   * **<title></title>:** This sets the title of the page, which is displayed in the browser's tab.   * **<body></body>:** This contains the visible content of the page.   * **<h1></h1>:** This is a heading element.   * **<p></p>:** This is a paragraph element.  You can customize this basic structure to create more complex webpages. For example, you can add more HTML elements to create different sections, such as a header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer. You can also use CSS to style your webpage and make it look more attractive.
